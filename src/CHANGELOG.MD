### HOTFIX
- changed bean logic to require beans to be clicked instead of the bean merchant being accessible to support randomizing the bean merchant
- fixed logic for the HF skull near Gerudo Valley which was assuming can_blast_or_smash when adult and now requires a Hammer. child logic there is unchanged

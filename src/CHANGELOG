= prio 3 =
- reimplement logic editor

        - could add a element index to store unused elements instead of deleting them. so the garbage collector can chill
    - buffer logic checks, update on item update
        - restructure events, item changed ==> logic update -> logic changed ==> location update
        - bundle events into a single one
    - maybe analize logic to check what item changes whitch logic

### TODOS

- add warning dialog to download update if needed

- change grids to new format
    {
        "type": "item" | "text" | "icon" | "empty",
        "value": ITEM_ID | string | PATH | undefined,
        "visible": LOGIC (false => like empty)
    }

- move dungeon state to own file
    - dungeon state has nothing to do with the general item lists
    - data moved, code has to follow suit

- custom layout (aka build yourself a tracker)

- implement settings for dungeon status control

- custom element using 2 list-select
    - add search options
    - 1 list with deactivated elements
    - 1 list with activated elements
    - buttons for (de-)activating elements
